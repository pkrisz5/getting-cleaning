# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The following steps were carried out in the dataset:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Files:

* **run_analysis.R** Contains the script that creates the two result files from source data
* **tidy_data.txt** Contains the tidy dataset with mean and standard deviation containing variables
* **tidy_data_averages.txt** Dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
* **codebook.md** Contains the destcription of variables
